                            Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold the promise of revolutionizing transportation, yet developing
                            robust decision-making systems for complex urban navigation remains a significant challenge.
                            This project addresses this by developing and evaluating a reinforcement learning (RL)
                            framework for autonomous driving within the CARLA simulator. A Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
                            agent, integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction from
                            camera imagery and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for temporal understanding, was
                            implemented from scratch. The agent was trained to select from six discrete driving actions.
                            Initial training attempts relying on pure exploration proved insufficient. Consequently, a
                            modified strategy incorporating CARLA's built-in autopilot as a guiding baseline was
                            adopted, alongside a custom reward function encouraging both safety and driving speed. After
                            40,000 training frames, the final model demonstrated a significant improvement in driving
                            performance compared to its untrained state and the baseline autopilot. The agent
                            successfully navigated simulated urban environments, both with and without traffic,
                            exhibiting smooth control, collision avoidance, and lane adherence. This work validates the
                            efficacy of the CNN+LSTM DDQN approach for autonomous driving tasks in simulation and
                            highlights the importance of guided learning strategies. The developed system provides a
                            foundational step towards more sophisticated autonomous decision-making.

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            With the rapid development of technology, autonomous vehicles provide a potential way to
                            revolutionize transportation by improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and enhancing
                            mobility. However, developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) capable of safely and efficiently
                            navigating complex urban environments is a significant challenge in both artificial
                            intelligence and robotics fields. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to handle the vast
                            variability and unpredictability inherent in real-world driving scenarios. Hence,
                            reinforcement learning seems to be a possible solution to autonomous driving and is gaining
                            popularity in the Robotics field. The primary problem addressed in this project is to
                            develop a robust decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles using reinforcement
                            learning (RL). Since real-world data is not easy to obtain, the whole system would be
                            implemented in the CARLA simulator, a realistic open-source simulator for developing
                            autonomous vehicles.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Approaches</h4>
                        <p>
                            The project consists of three main components: a simulator, the environment state, and an
                            agent. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <div class="col-sm-8 offset-sm-2">
                            <img src="../assets/images/works/projects/CARLA_RL/OverallProjectWorkflow.png"
                                alt="OverallProjectWorkflow" class="img-fluid">

                        <p>
                            <br><br>
                            The simulator generates environmental data. The environment state provides input for the
                            model, including observations and rewards. The agent is the reinforcement
                            learning model that is trained. By taking observations, it generates actions which
                            are control commands sent back to the car in the simulator.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h6>> 1. CARLA Simulator</h6>
                        <p>
                            CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research that provides a powerful
                            Python API to control simulation aspects like traffic, pedestrians, weather, and sensors. It
                            allows configuration of diverse sensors such as LIDARs, cameras, depth sensors, and GPS. In
                            this project, CARLA was used to generate environmental datasets and provide camera frame
                            observations for the agent. An RGB-camera with 640 x 480 resolution and a 110-degree FOV was
                            used, along with a collision sensor. To simulate traffic, 15 non-player characters (NPCs)
                            were spawned. For each epoch, the environment was reset, and the car was spawned in a random
                            position to enable learning in diverse situations. The agent could choose from six discrete
                            actions: hard left-turn, soft left-turn, straight, soft right-turn, hard right-turn, and
                            emergency stop.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h6>> 2. Driving Policy (Reinforcement Learning, RL)</h6>
                        <p>
                            The project's goal was to develop a DDQN model so a car can cruise autonomously without
                            collisions. A study by Khlifi et al. (2025) suggested a CNN+LSTM-based DDQN agent is a
                            good approach. The workflow starts with capturing and preprocessing image frames from a
                            front-facing camera. A CNN extracts spatial features (e.g., road structure, obstacles),
                            which are then fed into an LSTM to capture temporal dependencies, enabling the agent to
                            understand motion and context. The LSTM's output goes through fully connected layers to
                            generate Q-values for each possible driving action. During training, DDQN logic, using a
                            target network alongside the online network, updates the CNN, LSTM, and fully connected
                            layers based on observed rewards to minimize overestimation bias. The final action is
                            selected by picking the one with the highest Q-value.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            The DDQN agent was implemented with the following key settings:
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Discount Factor</b>: 0.99, to prioritize long-term rewards. </li>
                            <li><b>Learning Rate</b>: 2e-4 for the Adam optimizer. </li>
                            <li><b>Batch Size</b>: 64. </li>
                            <li><b>Epsilon Greedy Exploration</b>: Epsilon starts at 1.0, decays to a
                                final value of 0.05 over 50,000 steps. </li>
                            <li><b>Loss Function</b>: SmoothL1Loss, which is less sensitive to outliers than
                                MSELoss. </li>
                            <li><b>Polyak Averaging</b>: 5e-3, used for soft updates of the target network.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            The <b>DriverModel</b> consists of a three-layer CNN for feature extraction, an LSTM network
                            with a hidden size of 256 to process the sequential features, and a fully connected layer to
                            output the Q-values for the six possible actions.
                        </p>

                        <h6>1. Initial driving status without model training and autopilot</h6>

                                    Before we started to train the model, it was important to check if our code works
                                    properly. Since we want to train an RL model, we need to randomly make the car agent
                                    start driving around. In the first video, we first test our agent without any
                                    training. As the video showed, the agent is just purely driving around and trying to
                                    maximize its speed as fast as possible. Since there is no goal point for the agent
                                    to drive, the agent is just driving recklessly by crashing into obstacles or driving
                                    in the wrong lane. It was also not following the traffic lights. This phenomenon
                                    caused the learning result to be unsatisfying even after training with a ton of
                                    epochs. Since there is no penalty in the reward function on violating the traffic
                                    lights and crossing lanes, the agent was just trying to not collide with other
                                    obstacles and driving recklessly. This is not what we want to see.

                        <h6>2. Initial driving status with autopilot but without model training</h6>
                        <div class="row">

                                    <br>
                                    To deal with the problem mentioned in previous section, we introduce an autopilot
                                    feature
                                    provided by the CARLA simulator. The original driving status of introducing the
                                    autopilot feature can be seen in the second video. With no traffic on the
                                    road, the autopilot seems to be able to drive in the town. Although it sometimes
                                    collides with the obstacle on the road or violating the other lanes, it still can be
                                    able to finish its job.

                                        However, when it comes to adding traffic in the town as the
                                        third video showed, with more obstacles in the town, the higher the chance
                                        that the autopilot failed to drive properly. Therefore, we can now train the
                                        model
                                        based on the autopilot feature instead of purely train the model from a random
                                        state.

                                        After training with 20000 frames, which is half the way of the total training,
                                        the agent can now be way better to drive in the town with traffic. Although it
                                        still sometimes runs into obstacles or other cars, there is a significant
                                        improvement compared to the original autopilot. The fifth video showed

                                    The final model of the training with 40000 frames is quite satisfying. The agent is
                                    now able to drive safely in the town in both situations – with traffic and without
                                    traffic. There is no collision that occurs and the agent can drive smoothly without
                                    invading the other lanes. The sixth video (left one) showed the agent of final model
                                    driving in a nontraffic world while the seventh video (right one) showed the agent of

                            <h4>Summary</h4>
                            <p>
                                Initially, without any training, the agent drove recklessly, aiming only to maximize
                                speed, resulting in frequent crashes and traffic violations. This approach led to
                                unsatisfying learning results. To address this, CARLA's built-in autopilot was
                                introduced as a baseline guide. While the autopilot could navigate an empty town, its
                                performance degraded significantly with traffic. The model was then trained using the
                                autopilot as a starting point. After 20,000 training frames, the agent showed
                                significant improvement, although it still had occasional collisions. The final model,
                                after 40,000 frames, was quite satisfying, enabling the agent to drive smoothly and
                                safely in environments both with and without traffic, avoiding collisions and adhering
                                to lanes.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The trained agent demonstrated a marked improvement over both its untrained state and
                                the baseline CARLA autopilot. It successfully navigated smoothly, avoided collisions,
                                and maintained lane discipline in various scenarios. However, there is room for
                                improvement. The current six-action discrete control could be modified to be linear for
                                smoother driving. Additionally, the reward function could be adjusted to penalize
                                stopping, as the agent sometimes stops indefinitely behind a stalled vehicle to avoid a
                                collision.
